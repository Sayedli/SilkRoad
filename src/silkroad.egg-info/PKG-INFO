# SilkRoad

SilkRoad is a modular algorithmic trading bot designed for showcasing production-ready architecture while remaining practical for strategy research, backtesting, and live deployment. The stack favors readability and extensibility so you can iterate on strategies quickly and plug into venues ranging from paper-trading to Interactive Brokers.

## Key Capabilities
- Data layer with pluggable feeds (CCXT for crypto, in-memory feeds for tests).
- Strategy engine with registry pattern for quickly adding new alpha models.
- Execution abstraction with paper trading and Interactive Brokers connectivity via `ib_insync`.
- Backtesting harness powered by Backtrader with analytics-friendly result exports.
- Risk management hooks plus monitoring/notification adapters.
- SQLite-backed analytics store for trades and performance metrics.

## Project Layout
- `src/silkroad/config`: Typed configuration models and YAML loader.
- `src/silkroad/data`: Market data feeds (CCXT, static) and factory helpers.
- `src/silkroad/strategy`: Strategy base class, registry, and reference momentum strategy.
- `src/silkroad/execution`: Execution engines (paper, IBKR) and registry.
- `src/silkroad/backtesting`: Backtesting engine with Backtrader bridge and result helpers.
- `src/silkroad/risk`: Risk limit definitions and validation logic.
- `src/silkroad/monitoring`: Notification interface (print logger for now).
- `src/silkroad/analytics`: SQLite persistence helpers for trades and metrics.
- `src/silkroad/cli`: Click-powered CLI entry point.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies (use your preferred tool, e.g. `uv`, `poetry`, or `pip`):
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   pip install -e .[dev]  # optional extras
   ```
2. Copy the example config and adjust credentials/symbols:
   ```bash
   cp configs/example.paper.yml configs/local.yml
   ```
3. Run a paper session:
   ```bash
   silkroad --config configs/local.yml live
   ```
4. Backtest:
   ```bash
   silkroad --config configs/local.yml backtest
   ```
   Results print to the console and persist into `analytics/silkroad.db` when analytics are enabled.

## IBKR Roadmap
The `IBKRExecutionEngine` in `src/silkroad/execution/ibkr.py` boots an `ib_insync` client, sizes orders off Net Liquidation value, and logs fills into the analytics store. Next milestones to consider:
1. Support bracket/stop orders and smarter scaling logic.
2. Add automatic reconnection and heartbeat monitoring for TWS/Gateway sessions.
3. Stream primary market data through IBKR instead of external feeds.
4. Extend analytics to capture slippage versus reference prices and risk-attribution stats.

## Development
- Linting: `ruff check src tests`
- Type checks: `mypy src`
- Tests: `pytest`
